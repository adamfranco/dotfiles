# dotfiles
Included in this repository a set of dotfiles I use to set up my unix environment. Feel free to use them as the basis for your own.
The only personal info you definitely want to change is the `.gitconfig`'s setting for name and email address.

## Usage ##

1. Clone this repository to your home directory
2. Make backups of any of the dot-files in this directory in case you want to retain existing settings.
3. `cd dotfiles/`
4. Create a `.bashrc.local` file to hold any personal/override settings.
5. Edit `.gitconfig` and replace my name and email with yours.
6. `./create_symlinks`
